Hi, my name is Scott, and I'm a mathematics Ph.D. working in Machine Learning. Professionally, I specialize in applying machine learning and statistical techniques to solving business problems and producing measurable outcomes at scale. Otherwise, in no particular order, I enjoy cooking, random artistic pursuits, watching television and reading.
